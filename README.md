# Neovim VSCode setup

This repository contains my Neovim configuration which also has parallel configuration for the [Neovim Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim). Tried to keep the experience as close as possible for both platforms.
